# Roll20 Parser

*Work in Progress*

Generate a JSON document containing the character information scraped from a Roll20 Character sheet.

* Requires downloading the rendered sheet HTML from Roll20.
* Currently accomplished by setting the sheet to pop-out into a separate window and using the browser's dev tools to grab the rendered sheet.
